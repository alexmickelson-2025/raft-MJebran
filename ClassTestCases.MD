## Part One
1. When a leader is active it sends a heart beat within 50ms.  
2. When a node receives an AppendEntries from another node, then first node remembers that other node is the current leader.  
3. When a new node is initialized, it should be in follower state.  
4. When a follower doesn't get a message for 300ms then it starts an election.  
5. When the election time is reset, it is a random value between 150 and 300ms.  
   1. between  
   2. random: call n times and make sure that there are some that are different (other properties of the distribution if you like)  
6. When a new election begins, the term is incremented by 1.  
   1. Create a new node, store id in variable.  
   2. wait 300 ms  
   3. reread term (?)  
   4. assert after is greater (by at least 1)  
7. When a follower does get an AppendEntries message, it resets the election timer. (i.e. it doesn't start an election even after more than 300ms)  
8. Given an election begins, when the candidate gets a majority of votes, it becomes a leader. (think of the easy case; can use two tests for single and multi-node clusters)  
9. Given a candidate receives a majority of votes while waiting for unresponsive node, it still becomes a leader.  
10. A follower that has not voted and is in an earlier term responds to a RequestForVoteRPC with yes. (the reply will be a separate RPC)  
11. Given a candidate server that just became a candidate, it votes for itself.  
12. Given a candidate, when it receives an AppendEntries message from a node with a later term, then candidate loses and becomes a follower.  
13. Given a candidate, when it receives an AppendEntries message from a node with an equal term, then candidate loses and becomes a follower.  
14. If a node receives a second request for vote for the same term, it should respond no. (again, separate RPC for response)  
15. If a node receives a second request for vote for a future term, it should vote for that node.  
16. Given a candidate, when an election timer expires inside of an election, a new election is started.  
17. When a follower node receives an AppendEntries request, it sends a response.  
18. Given a candidate receives an AppendEntries from a previous term, then rejects.  
19. When a candidate wins an election, it immediately sends a heart beat.  
20. (testing persistence to disk will be a later assignment)  


## Notes
- All RPCs should be implemented as **asynchronous** calls to simulate real-world distributed system behavior.

## Part Two

### **1. Node Initialization**
- **Test Case:** When a new node is initialized, it should be in the follower state.
---

### **2. Candidate Self-Voting**
- **Test Case:** When a server becomes a candidate, it votes for itself.
---

### **3. Leader Recognition**
- **Test Case:** When a node receives an `AppendEntries` message, it remembers the sender as the leader.
---

### **4. AppendEntries Response**
- **Test Case:** When a follower receives an `AppendEntries` request, it sends a response.
---

### **5. Voting for Previous Term**
- **Test Case:** A follower in an earlier term responds to a `RequestForVoteRPC` with "yes."
---

### **6. Randomized Election Timeout**
- **Test Case:** When the election timer is reset, it is a random value between 150ms and 300ms.
---

### **7. Term Increment on Election Start**
- **Test Case:** When a new election begins, the term is incremented by 1.
---

### **8. Follower Receiving Later-Term AppendEntries**
- **Test Case:** When a candidate receives an `AppendEntries` message from a node with a later term, it becomes a follower.
---

### **9. Duplicate Vote Request Handling**
- **Test Case:** If a node receives a second vote request for the same term, it responds with "no."
---

### **10. Election Timer Expiry**
- **Test Case:** When a follower doesnâ€™t get a message for 300ms, it starts an election.
